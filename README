I've created this project to showcase my data analytics skills using SQL. I followed along with this Youtube tutorial in order to learn and execute the necessary code! 
The tutorial helped me put what I learned in class into a real world example that I could use to show my potential employers my understanding of SQL!

I've also added in the csv file I used to load my database with data!
